# hello-world
~First repository to understand how to use GitHub~

Edit 1:
I just learned about how to create new branches where I can work on, and I am just doing some changes by my own (here, the README.md is edited right now).

Edit 2:
This time, we edit after cloning the repository from GitHub to our computer (using the command "git clone HTTPSlink").
We are now learning how to push the modifications made to the GitHub repository.

Edit 3:
After learning about the "git push" command, we are now learning about the "git pull" command: it is used to update the repository in your computer from the changes done to your repository in GitHub (this is your remote), in order for them to be the same. This is better since you'll work on an always updated version of your code.
