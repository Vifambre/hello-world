# hello-world
~First repository to understand how to use GitHub~

Edit 1:
I just learned about how to create new branches where I can work on, and I am just doing some changes by my own (here, the README.md is edited right now).

Edit 2:
This time, we edit after cloning the repository from GitHub to our computer (using the command "git clone HTTPSlink").
We are now learning how to push the modifications made to the GitHub repository.
